## Steps to work on this tool:
  - First select the algorithm on which you want to plot the graph
  - then put the value of n starting from 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1000 etc. and hit plot every time
  - do not put huge values in later algos, they will eat up your CPU, try putting small values b/t 1 to 100 only.
  - you can go upto 10000000 for 1, 2, 5, 6 th algos, on other just put below 50 only.
  - you will see the trend of runtime wrt the value of n.
  - Similarly for the next algo, with same inputs so that you can analyse the difference in runtime b/t the algo.
  - You will see someting like this...!

## You will see the Big-O graph which is also show in the Big-O cheetsheet
