<p>Welcome to Day 1 of the DSA&nbsp;Coding Challenge: </p><p>Todays Goals (Arrays) : </p><p>-Learn Big O&nbsp;Analysis to find Time and Space complexity</p><p>-Array Data Structure Crash Course</p><p>Question 1:&nbsp;<em>Sorted Squared Array</em> - You are given an array of Integers in which each subsequent value is not less than the previous value. Write a function that takes this array as an input and returns a new array with the squares of each number sorted in ascending order.</p><p>Question 2: <em>Monotonic Array - </em>An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing. An array&nbsp;is monotone increasing if all&nbsp;its elements from left to right are non-decreasing. An array&nbsp;is monotone decreasing if all&nbsp; its elements from left to right are non-increasing. Given an integer array return&nbsp;true&nbsp;if the given array is monotonic, or&nbsp;false&nbsp;otherwise. </p><p>All the best !&nbsp;</p>
